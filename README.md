This program is based off of the board game, Power Grid. More information on the game can be found here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid

This program is intended to be a base for other programs to plug into to play the game. This program basically acts as a "game master", and just enforces rules of play. The intent is that bots will be plugged into it to handle strategy in playing the game, although theoretically, a plugin could be made to allow for a human to play as well.
